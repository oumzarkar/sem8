import tkinter as tk: Imports the Tkinter module, which provides functions and classes for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
from tkinter import ttk, filedialog: Imports specific modules and classes from Tkinter for creating widgets and handling file dialogs.
from PIL import ImageTk, Image: Imports classes from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for working with images.
import numpy as np: Imports the NumPy library for numerical computations.
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model: Imports the function load_model from Keras for loading a pre-trained model.
model = load_model('my_cnn_model.h5'): Loads the pre-trained CNN model from the file 'my_cnn_model.h5'.
class_labels = [...]: Defines class labels for the fashion categories used by the model.
def predict_image():: Defines a function predict_image() to handle the prediction process when the user uploads an image.
file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(): Opens a file dialog to allow the user to select an image file. If a file is selected, its path is stored in file_path.
if not file_path: return: Checks if the user canceled the file dialog. If so, exits the function.
Image Processing:
Opens the selected image file using PIL's Image.open() function and converts it to grayscale.
Resizes the image to the required input size of the model (28x28 pixels).
Normalizes the pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Reshapes the image into a format compatible with the model.
Model Prediction:
Uses the loaded model to make predictions on the preprocessed image.
Determines the predicted label based on the class with the highest probability.
Display:
Opens the original image file without grayscale conversion and resizes it for display.
Converts the image to a Tkinter-compatible format using ImageTk.PhotoImage().
Updates the image label widget with the displayed image.
Updates the status label widget with the predicted label.
Widget Creation:
Creates the main application window (root) using tk.Tk().
Sets the window title to "Fashion MNIST Image Classifier".
Adds a button (upload_button) for uploading an image and triggering prediction.
Adds labels (image_label and status_label) for displaying the image and prediction status.
root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for user interactions and updates the GUI accordingly.
